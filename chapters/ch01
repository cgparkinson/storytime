Alice went to the shop.
His large alien head bobbled on his stumpy body, his three eyes twitching.
He looked up and he saw a huge tower of bananas! 
At the top of the tower was a monkey with big beady eyes. 
The monkey shouted down 'hey!'
The alien looked back in fear. 
Oh how fearful he was poor lil baby. 
Why did today feel like such a strange day?
